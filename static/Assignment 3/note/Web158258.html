purpose of this web site design is to navigate all contents of the site, for very large database, without missing
any thing, backtracking, duplicating same pages, losing track of progression, position.
I am talking about information as large as wiki pages.

Not using the top navigation bar was big decision, so was not putting the site map

In my personal experience, I returned to the home page to go to a different page.
Navigation bar and site map has equivalent purpose.
Hence the home page has feature of the day, and site map.


Search bar is top left, like the browsers address bar where we search google. This is more intuitive than top right.


Website is very content focused.
Static navigation is prevalent.
The only reason that the navigation is top, and horizontal, I found is because we scroll down to find more content.
When user is scrolling, user must be able to focus on the content, and not distracted by navigation, ads, footer, etc.

How often do people read the footer and the end of website? I do not.

Home > Navigation > Content.


Two column Navigator is separate to folder navigator. HTML files do not need to be in folder structure.


Content section promises that there will be nothing but the content.
No header, no footer, no ads. Ad space is reserved on the right side


Theme of my website - content focused.


My view does not support vertical screen.
Only uses horizontal, tablet, mobile wide screen.


Content focused without distraction.


Purpose of this website is information directory, wiki, forum. Large information in tree.


Things taught in lecture, and popular, but deliberately decided not to include.


Homepage has:
Featured content
Site map

DESIGN



https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_website_layout.asp

To quickly browse the content of link, the navigation must be static. Unlike stupid Windows 8
if using whitespace instead of borders, must be large enough to separate content
eyes go in one place, not all over many places, therefore navigation icon is not address

Side navigation has separate scrolling to main content.



https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/
While scrolling, player eyes are at bottom of page, the navigation at top is far out of sight.
If sidebar navigation, then scrolling cannot hide the navigation for player to focus on the content,
hence the side column navigation must be automatically hidden, and appear quickly without interference.
Player must be able to focus at the content without multimedia information overload, distraction.
If Scrolling was left to right, instead of up to down, then top navigation bar would be distraction.
